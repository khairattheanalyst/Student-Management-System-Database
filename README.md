## Overview

The **Student Management System (SMS)** is a relational database designed to efficiently manage and organize information about students, departments, courses, instructors, and enrollments within a university setting.  

The system supports key administrative operations such as:  
- Registering students and instructors  
- Assigning instructors to courses  
- Enrolling students in courses  
- Generating analytical and operational reports through SQL queries  

The database was created using **PostgreSQL**, with structured relationships and constraints to ensure **data integrity**, **scalability**, and **efficient querying**.

---

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and create a relational database for a Student Management System using SQL. The database should:  
- Efficiently store and manage data on students, courses, instructors, and enrollments.  
- Support administrative tasks such as course assignments and enrollments.  
- Allow users to generate dynamic, data-driven reports for academic insights.

| `Course_Name` | VARCHAR | Course title |
| `Department_ID` | VARCHAR (FK) | References `Departments.Department_ID` |

---

### Instructors Table
Stores instructor data including the department they are affiliated with.

---

### Enrollments Table
Tracks student course registrations.

| Column | Data Type | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `Enrollment_ID` | VARCHAR (PK) | Unique enrollment ID |
| `Student_ID` | VARCHAR (FK) | References `Students.Student_ID` |
| `Course_ID` | VARCHAR (FK) | References `Courses.Course_ID` |
| `Enrollment_Date` | DATE | Date of enrollment |

---

### CourseInstructors Table
Links instructors and courses (many-to-many relationship).

| Column | Data Type | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `Assignment_ID` | VARCHAR (PK) | Unique identifier for course assignment |
| `Instructor_ID` | VARCHAR (FK) | References `Instructors.Instructor_ID` |
| `Course_ID` | VARCHAR (FK) | References `Courses.Course_ID` |

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD visually represents the relationships between tables in the database.

### Relationship Overview
- One Department â†’ Many Students, Courses, and Instructors  
- One Student â†’ Many Enrollments  
- One Course â†’ Many Enrollments  
- One Instructor â†’ Many Course Assignments  
- Courses and Instructors have a **many-to-many** relationship via `CourseInstructors`

---

## Data Population

Each table was populated with realistic sample data including:  
- 6 Departments  
- 20 Courses  
- 15 Instructors  
- 50 Students  
- 100 Enrollment Records  
- 28 Course Assignments  

The dataset provides a realistic simulation of university operations.

## SQL-Based Reporting Questions

### Students & Enrollments Report

**1. How many students are currently enrolled in each course?**  
The result shows the number of students enrolled in each course, with *Introduction to Programming (CS001)*, *Data Structures (CS002)*, and *Linear Algebra (CS009)* having the highest (7 students each), and *Academic Writing (CS019)* with the lowest (3 students).

---

**2. Which students are enrolled in multiple courses, and which courses are they taking?**  
The result shows that **49 students** are enrolled in multiple courses. *Student ID 004 â€“ Chiamaka Obi* registered for **three courses**, making her the only student with the highest number of course enrollments.

---

**3. What is the total number of students per department across all courses?**  
The *Computer Science Department* has the highest number of students (**12 students**).  
*Physics* and *Biology Departments* have the least number of students (**7 students each**).

---

### Course & Instructor Analysis

**4. Which courses have the highest number of enrollments?**  
*CS009 (Linear Algebra)*, *CS001 (Introduction to Programming)*, and *CS002 (Data Structures)* have the highest number of student enrollments.

---

**5. Which department has the least number of students?**  
The *Physics* and *Biology Departments* have the least number of students.

---

### Data Integrity & Operational Insights

**6. Are there any students not enrolled in any course?**  
There are **no students** currently not enrolled in any course.

---

**7. How many courses does each student take on average?**  
Each student takes **two courses on average**.

---

**8. What is the gender distribution of students across courses and instructors?**  
*Mr. Daniel Peters*, who teaches *Linear Algebra*, has the **highest number of female students** in his class.  
*Dr. Samuel Okoro* and *Dr. Samuel Kuti*, who teach *Data Structures*, have the **highest number of male students** in their classes.

---

**9. Which course has the highest number of male or female students enrolled?**

## Query Logic Summary

| Query Objective | Logic Explanation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Total Students per Course | Counts enrollments grouped by course name. |
| Students Enrolled in Multiple Courses | Uses `HAVING COUNT() > 1` to identify students in multiple courses. |
| Students per Department | Groups students by department via `Department_ID`. |
| Average Courses per Student | Calculates the mean value of total enrolled courses per student. |
| Gender Distribution | Joins multiple tables to summarize male/female counts per instructor and course. |
